Client and Software Requirements:
The client, The Gaming Room, sought to expand its gaming platform for Draw It Or Lose It beyond the current Android-only version to support multiple platforms. They needed help setting up the environment and optimizing development for a cross-platform application that would maintain the core elements of the Android app. Requirements included unique game and team names, single-instance memory management for the game, multiple players per team, and the ability to support single or multiple teams in each game.

Software Design Goals:
The Gaming Room wanted a cross-platform game based on their existing Android application. Key requirements included a unique naming structure for each game and team, memory constraints to allow only one instance of the game, multi-team support, and a way to assign multiple players to each team.

Documentation Development:
My instructor noted that I exceeded expectations, particularly in the evaluations section of the documentation. The process of organizing requirements and providing clear evaluations helped me avoid unnecessary complexity while still meeting all requirements.

Using the Design Document:
The structured design document template was particularly helpful. By following a clear layout, I avoided over-documenting and was able to ensure all necessary details were included without becoming overly complex.

Potential Improvements:
If I could revise one part, Iâ€™d include pseudocode. Although I find pseudocode challenging, I've learned it helps clarify larger projects and provides the team with an understanding of technical requirements and necessary skills.

Interpreting and Meeting User Needs:
Successfully translating client needs into technical terms is essential to creating software that meets expectations. This skill bridges communication between the client and developers, ensuring the final product aligns with the client's vision and prevents misunderstandings.

Design Approach and Future Strategies:
My approach centers on research and step-by-step planning. While it may seem tedious, thorough research prevents costly mistakes later. Following an Agile methodology helps manage sections incrementally and ensures I detail each part for smoother development and testing.
